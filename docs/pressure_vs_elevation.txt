VLCi is publishing station pressure uncorrected rather than sea-level-reduced pressure (SLP).
Across a city the horizontal pressure gradient at one instant is tiny (fractions of a hPa), so big differences mainly reflect elevation, plus minor effects from timestamp offsets and sensor calibration.

As elevation increases, there is less overlying atmospheric mass, so atmospheric pressure decreases with increasing elevation.

Valencia Airport (W03_VALENCIAAEROPUERTO_10m) sits around 73 m above sea level; Nazaret and Av. de Francia are basically at the coast (~3 m and a handful of meters, respectively). The 8–9 hPa gap we can see between AVD. Francia (~1012) and the Airport (~1003–1004) is exactly what is expected from that height difference (~70 m × 12 hPa/100 m ≈ 8–9 hPa).

If we need apples-to-apples across stations in the pipeline in a later phase, we can compute an SLP-like normalization:
1. Keep presion_ba as-is (station pressure) for raw provenance.
2. Add a derived pressure_slp_hpa using each station’s elevation (airport ≈ 73 m; Nazaret ≈ 3 m; Av. Francia ≈ ~5–10 m) and a standard-atmosphere adjustment. Even a simple rule-of-thumb (add ~0.12 hPa per meter of elevation divided by 10 → ≈ 0.12 hPa/m?Note: the precise barometric reduction uses temperature; the best quick approximation is the exponential barometric formula) will probably collapse the inter-station gaps.

Back-of-envelope check we can bake into a unit test:
“Does Δpressure × 8 m/hPa ≈ Δelevation?”

For the first test sample, (1012.0 − 1003.4) hPa × 8 m/hPa ≈ 69 m, which matches VLC’s field elevation. That’s the smoking altitude.
